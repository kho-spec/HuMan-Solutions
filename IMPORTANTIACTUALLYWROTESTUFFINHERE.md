# HuMan-Solutions
Parallax scrolling was authorized to be in another subpage.
My 3 extra site features were the rotating image hover in our mission, the hover flex-grow + the flex-start border on Meet the Team.
If I were to summarize this project it would be 'I bit off more than I could chew' so the last page as of the deadline is unfinished because i tried taking on something I didn't have time for (a form!). I can get that to you soon.
